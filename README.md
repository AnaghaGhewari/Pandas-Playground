# Pandas-Playground
This repository contains my hands-on practice with Pandas for data manipulation and analysis. I completed structured tasks using the Pandas Playground, working with DataFrames, data cleaning, filtering, grouping, and basic transformations.  This work builds a strong foundation for data analysis and machine learning.
